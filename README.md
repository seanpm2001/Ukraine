# Ukraine

[Help the Internet Archive preserve the Ukrainian Internet](https://archive.org/donate)

**Warning:** This project is a bit political. I have tried to tone things down, but this is a serious problem being discussed.

I originally wasn't going to make this repository, as I felt it was too late. I have decided that it is never too late.

I have been following the Russian invasion of Ukraine ever since the buildup of troops just months before the invasion. I knew something bad was coming.

During the start of the invasion, I watched footage of the war pretty often. I was horrified. I still followed it, I watch for changes in the conflict every single day. I became less obsessed with it over time, but I still cared deeply.

## Ukrainian support

I support Ukraine. Ukraine isn't a Neo-Nazi country. I am sick and tired of this political blame game. When Russia destroyed Ukraines Holocaust memorial (Babyn Yar) where the Nazis massacred over 33.7 thousand jews over 70 years ago (in a bombing of Kyiv on 2022 March 1st) it became clear to any sane, or partially sane person that Putins Russia is the new Nazi monster.

The fact that Russia just keeps killing civilians and targetting civilians is clear evidence of war crimes. Thousands of war crimes were committed in the first week of the 2022 invasion. Putin is a war criminal.

As a hobby, I have been downloading the Wikipedia article on the 2022 invasion of Ukraine on a daily basis. I hope to combine these and get a version history document. I check between the days for changes.

## Russia

There are still good people in Russia, just as there are still good people in every country in the world (even in North Korea) There are Russians who protested, there are Russians who helped Ukrainians, there are good Russians in Russia. Putin is definitely NOT part of the good side of Russia. Please do not assume that someone is bad just because they are Russian.
